## MVP/Post MVP

### MVP
* Find and use external API
* Fetch food items and total carbohydrate amount 
* Render data on page
* Allow users to search for food from a database
* Allow users to add food items from the results to a list
* Allow users to adjust serving amount to adjust carbohydrate total
* Allow users to add custom insulin to carbohydrate ratio
* Carbohydrates will be totaled in the list


### Post MVP
* Allow users to filter food items 
* Allow users to add blood gluocose readings
* Allow users to save and update insulin to carbohydrate ratio
* Use localstorage to store created meals and frequently added food items
